# Calculator Skill

## Description
This skill lets you use perform simple mathematical calculations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The LLM should write and execute Python code to compute results accurately.

## Key Principles
- Always use Python's built-in operators for calculations.
- Handle basic arithmetic operations.
- Output the result clearly, e.g., using `print()`.

## Examples

### Example 1: Addition
**User Query:** What is 5 + 7?

**Response Plan:**
1. Write a Python script to add the numbers.
2. Execute the script and return the result.

**Python Code:**
```python
print(5 + 7)
```

### Example 2: Subtraction
**User Query:** What is 10 - 3?

**Response Plan:**
1. Write a Python script to subtract the numbers.
2. Execute the script and return the result.

**Python Code:**
```python
print(10 - 3)
```

### Example 3: Multiplication
**User Query:** What is 6 * 4?

**Response Plan:**
1. Write a Python script to multiply the numbers.
2. Execute the script and return the result.

**Python Code:**
```python
print(6 * 4)
```

### Example 4: Division
**User Query:** What is 15 / 3?

**Response Plan:**
1. Write a Python script to divide the numbers.
2. Execute the script and return the result.

**Python Code:**
```python
print(15 / 3)
```

### Example 5: Complex Expression
**User Query:** What is (2 + 3) * 4 - 5?

**Response Plan:**
1. Write a Python script to evaluate the expression.
2. Execute the script and return the result.

**Python Code:**
```python
print((2 + 3) * 4 - 5)
```
